Shadow Folder
=============

**This is a work in progress**.

The goal for this project is to abstract
the git "shadow" functionality currently built-in to
`Jirafs <http://github.com/coddingtonbear/jirafs>`_ into its own library
so it might be useful in implementations of Jirafs for other issue tracking
systems.
